The store object has two key methods which you need to know about.
The getState method allows you to inspect the current state held
in the store. And the dispatch method allows you to run actions
through your reducer, modifying the store. For example:

Actions:
var ADD_REPOSITORY = 'ADD_REPOSITORY';
var addRepository = function(repository) {
    return {
        type: ADD_REPOSITORY,
        repository: repository
    }
};

Reducer:
var repositoryReducer = function(state, action) {
    state = state || initialRepositoryState;
    if (action.type === actions.ADD_REPOSITORY) {
        return state.concat({
            name: action.repository,
            rating: null
        });
    }

dispath commands:
var actions = require('./actions');
> var store = require('./store');
> store.dispatch(actions.addRepository('joe'));
{ type: 'ADD_REPOSITORY', repository: 'joe' }
> store.getState();
[ { name: 'joe', rating: null } ]

Dispatching actions to the store is the sole way in which you
modify state using Redux, so you should get familiar with the flow of:

Creating an action
Handling it in a reducer
Triggering it using dispatch
