<!--in this folder you will put your test scripts.
Here is a sample test file (find context for this file in ThinkfulProjects/react-tester)

var React = require('react');
var TestUtils = require('react-addons-test-utils');
var should = require('chai').should();

var Image = require('../image');

describe('Image component', function() {
    it('Renders the image and description',  function() {
        var url = "http://www.example.com/image.png";
        var description = "Example description";

        var renderer = TestUtils.createRenderer();
        renderer.render(<Image url={url} description={description} />);
        var result = renderer.getRenderOutput();
        result.props.className.should.equal('gallery-image');

        var img = result.props.children[0];
        img.type.should.equal('img');
        img.props.src.should.equal(url);
        img.props.alt.should.equal(description);

        var p = result.props.children[1];
        p.type.should.equal('p');
        p.props.children.should.equal(description);
    });
});


In order to help you test components, React provides the Test Utilities addon.
This allows you to render a version of your component without needing access
to the DOM. Take a look at the test case. First, you create an instance of the
renderer. You then render an Image component, providing an example URL and
description.

Next, you call the getRenderOutput method of the renderer. This returns
the rendered React component. Using this you can check out the type and
props of the elements rendered by your component. So here, we check that
the correct class name is set, that there is an image with the correct src
and alt attributes, and that there is a <p> tag containing the description.

Try running the test using npm test. You should see that it passes with
flying colors.

The renderer performs what is known as shallow rendering. This means
that it will only render components one level deep. So if you try to
test the Gallery component, it will not render the Image components;
it will just leave them there with their props in place. This ensures
that your tests run quickly, and enforces the rule that you should only
test a single component at a time.
